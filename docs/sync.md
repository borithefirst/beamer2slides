# Sync: merging a changed beamer source into an edited Slides deck

Context: an AI writes the talk as beamer, `convert` turns it into a Slides deck, people edit that
deck, the AI (or a LaTeX user) edits the beamer again. `sync` brings the source changes into the
live deck without destroying the deck edits; `pull` brings deck edits back towards the source.

**Never lose deck edits** (`guard.py`): `convert` on an output folder that already has a deck
replaces that deck's whole content, so it now checks first whether anyone edited it and refuses
if they did — see [Never lose deck edits](#never-lose-deck-edits) at the end.

## Model: a three-way merge
- **base**: what the converter produced last time, recorded right after it was written
  (the deck's IR plus Google's read-back of each object it created).
- **ours**: the new conversion of the changed PDF (IR only; nothing is emitted to compare).
- **theirs**: the live deck now (`presentations.get`).

Source changes = base IR vs ours IR. Deck edits = base read-back vs live read-back.
**The base is always converter output, never the merged deck**: a deck edit keeps differing from
the base, so every later sync keeps it (a *deck override*) until the source says the same thing
(then ours == theirs for that field: *converged*, the override disappears from the reports).

Policy: **deck edits win**. A source change to a field the deck also edited is not applied; it is
reported as a conflict (with both versions) so the author can decide.

## Command
```
python -m beamer2slides sync deck.pdf --deck <url|id|out folder> [--out DIR] [--dry-run]
                                      [--overlays last|all] [--predict-places]
```
`--out` defaults to the folder given as `--deck` (else `out/<pdf stem>`). The new conversion goes to
`<out>/sync/ours/`, reports to `<out>/sync/sync-report.{json,md}` (`sync-report-dry-run.*` for a dry
run). `convert` records the first base itself (`snapshot.snapshot_after_convert`). Modules:
`identity.py` (keys, fingerprints, IR field hashes), `snapshot.py` (read-back, base.json, tags,
storage), `merge.py` (pure planning and diff3), `sync.py` (requests and the write loop).

## Identity
- **Slide key**: the beamer frame label (`\begin{frame}[label=results]` → PDF named destinations
  `results` and `results<n>` per overlay step; hyperref's own destinations have no `<n>` form,
  `extract.frame_labels`), else `title:<normalised title>#<occurrence>`, else `page:<n>`; a clash
  gets `~k`. Base and ours slides pair by label first; the rest by an order-keeping alignment of
  word similarity (+0.5 for the same title, at least 0.6; two different labels never pair), so an
  inserted or renamed frame doesn't shift keys. Unpaired ours slides get fresh keys.
  AI authors are told to label every frame (themes/google README, docs).
- **Element key** within a slide: `kind/role/ordinal` (e.g. `text/title/0`, `text/body/2`,
  `image/figure/0`, `image/math/1`), plus a **fingerprint**: plain text, PDF bbox, image sha1 of its
  crop, anchor element key. Ours elements inherit the key of the base element they match: most
  similar pairs first (0.6 text ratio + 0.3 geometry + 0.1 role; the key it would get anyway needs
  0.5 and counts 0.05 more, another key 0.35); unmatched elements get fresh ordinals. Titles and
  footers (one per slide) score at least 0.5 + 0.3 geometry + 0.2 text ratio with each other, so a
  renamed title keeps its key and goes back into its placeholder. Anchored
  elements (formula pictures, overlays, number balls) are matched after their anchors.
- **Units**: an element and the elements anchored to it are planned together (they share a group).
- **Deck objects**: the base records, per element, every object id created for it (main object
  first, then its `_g` group, number boxes, anchored pictures; `emit.element_objects` from the
  planned parts), plus the slide's other groups (blocks, rules). Objects created by sync get fresh
  unique ids (`b2s_<h6 slide key>_<h6 element key>_<generation+1><2 letters>`, new slides
  `b2s_<h6 slide key>_<tok>`). The element key is also written into the object's alt-text *title*
  (`b2s:<slide key>/<element key>`, groups untagged), so copies made in the Slides UI (new id, same
  tag) are recognised as user-added copies, not as the original.

## Base snapshot (`sync/base.json`, schema version 1)
```
{version: 1, generation, presentationId, revisionId, source: {pdf, sha1}, scale,
 page_size (PDF pt), deck_page_size, master_background (key), master_readback,
 slides: [{key, label, title, page, text, layout, background ("color:#rrggbb" | "png:<sha1>"), notes,
           objectId, layoutObjectId, background_readback, notes_readback, groups: [objectId...],
           order: [top-level objectIds, back to front],
           elements: [{key, id, kind, role, ir_hash, anchor (element key), ir (normalised IR),
                       fields: {text, position, size, style, image},
                       fingerprint: {text, bbox, image_sha1, anchor},
                       objects: [objectId...], main: objectId,
                       readback: {objectId: {kind, transform (absolute), size, box, parent_group, z,
                                             title, description, placeholder?, text, text_styles,
                                             paragraph_styles, text_style_hash, shape_style,
                                             shape_style_hash, image: {contentHash, sourceUrl, signature}?,
                                             children?, table?}}}]}]}
```
`ir_hash` hashes the element's IR without ids, spans and files, with `#page=N` links as slide keys
and floats to 0.01; `fields` hash its parts (position = top-left to 0.5 pt, size, the set of style
values, plain text, image), so a reworded line changes `text` and `size`, not `position`. Read-back
values are normalised (EMU→pt rounded to 0.01, scale to 1e-4, colours to hex or `theme:NAME`, group
children composed to absolute transforms, image hash = contentUrl path) so an untouched object
compares equal. Google issues new contentUrls for unchanged pictures now and then, so pictures and
picture backgrounds also carry a pixel `signature` (`<w>x<h>:` + 32 × 32 grey levels, downloaded when
the base is recorded and, at sync, only for live pictures whose URL hash differs): a picture counts
as replaced when its signature differs (ink-normalised difference ≥ 0.3 or another aspect ratio).
The base lists slides in the source's order, not the deck's, so a deck reorder stays a deck edit. Storage: locally in `<out>/sync/base.json`, and in Drive as a JSON file created by
the app (`drive.file` scope) whose id is kept in the presentation file's `appProperties.b2sBase`;
Drive is authoritative (anyone with the deck can sync), the local copy is a cache and fallback.
The base is replaced only when a sync wrote something or adopted converged deck fields (`generation` + 1).

## Deck edits detected (per object, per field)
geometry (box within 0.05 pt, scale within 1e-3), text content, text style, shape fill/outline,
image replaced, deleted (all or part of a unit), regrouped/ungrouped; user-added objects (no base
object, or a copied tag); slides added, deleted, reordered; speaker notes; slide background.
Z-order changes are not detected.

## Merge rules (per unit and field; `merge.plan_unit`)
| source (base→ours) | deck (base→theirs) | action |
|---|---|---|
| unchanged | anything | keep the deck (edited fields reported as overrides) |
| changed | unchanged | recreate the unit's objects from ours (same place in z-order and grouping) |
| position/size only | text or style, not geometry | `move`: shift the deck's objects by the source delta |
| changed | geometry | recreate, then re-apply the deck's transform change (`delta`: theirs · base⁻¹); if the source moved it too, the deck's position wins and it's a conflict |
| changed | text style / shape style | recreate, re-apply the deck's change: uniform over all runs → over all the text; some words (or a table) → the deck's run attributes onto the same words of the new text (character alignment, `sync.style_range_requests`); non-uniform paragraph styles → keep the deck, conflict. A conflict is reported only when the source changed the same style attributes |
| text changed | text changed | word-level diff3; clean → recreate and write the merged text; overlapping → keep the deck, conflict. In a table the diff3 runs per cell (`merge.table_merge`, applied with `cellLocation`); a row or column added on either side, or a cell holding a line break, makes the whole table a conflict |
| text / position changed | the deck shows exactly that (same text; a move the source now reproduces within 2 pt) | `adopt`: nothing written, reported as converged; the base takes ours IR and the deck's version of those fields (e.g. after `pull`) |
| picture file changed, same picture | anything | no change: the base takes the new hash (`snapshot.refresh_pictures`, reported as converged) |
| added: a picture | the deck already shows that picture (after a pull) | `adopt_object`: the person's object becomes the element's, nothing written (`sync.picture_adopter`) |
| picture changed | image replaced with the picture the source now draws | `adopt`: the deck's picture and box stay, reported as converged instead of a conflict |
| changed | group taken apart (the unit's `_g` group gone) | recreate without that group |
| changed | image replaced | keep the deck, conflict |
| changed | deleted (all or part) | keep deleted, conflict |
| deleted | unchanged | delete its objects |
| deleted | deleted | nothing |
| deleted | edited | keep, conflict |
| added | — | create |

A picture whose file the converter now writes differently but that puts the same thing on the page
(`snapshot.same_picture_file`: the same pixels where the new file is opaque, one flat colour under
it where it is transparent - the ground the older picture painted in) is not a source change: the
base takes the new hash and is saved, and the deck keeps its object, instead of every formula,
icon and ball being rewritten the first time a deck converted before that change is synced.
A picture that really is another one is still rewritten: a figure that is one `\includegraphics`
now keeps the image's own box and the author's own bytes, so on the first sync of a deck converted
before that it changes box and picture - one correct update, not a conflict.

A unit removed from the source is kept when its words went into a unit kept in conflict (classify
joined two paragraphs), so no text is lost. Slides: new frames are created at the aligned
position; frames removed from the source are deleted if the deck didn't touch them (no edits, no
user objects, same notes and background), else kept after their base predecessor and reported;
a frame the deck deleted stays deleted (a conflict if the source changed more than its frame counter);
the source order is applied only if the deck didn't reorder slides itself; user-added slides stay
after their live predecessor. Notes follow the text rules (diff3 against the notes read back);
a background the source changed is rewritten unless the deck changed it too (conflict).
Recreated units with holes or overlays are re-measured (`measure_places` scratch slides in the live
deck; leftovers `b2s_mNNN` of an interrupted run are deleted at the next start).

## Writing to the live deck
- Every batchUpdate carries `writeControl.requiredRevisionId`, chained through the responses. A
  mismatch before the first write re-reads and re-plans (at most 3 times), so concurrent edits are
  never overwritten; later batches (order, overrides) are planned on the deck sync itself wrote.
  Test hook: `B2S_SYNC_BEFORE_WRITE` (a shell command) runs once after planning, before any write.
- Pictures (new or changed figures, formula pictures, backgrounds) can't come from URLs: they go
  into a **staging deck** imported from a .pptx (`build_pptx`, pictures tagged `b2s-stage:N`), whose
  images' `contentUrl`s are used by `createImage` (plus a transform undoing its letterboxing) and
  `stretchedPictureFill` in the live deck (no public links). The staging file is deleted after the
  content batch: its contentUrls stop working once it's gone.
- New slides: `createSlide` with the layout (title/subtitle placeholders mapped, the others deleted
  after a read), then emit's `slide_parts` under renamed ids. The theme decoration sits on the
  layouts (`emit.plan_theme`), and backgrounds that don't show it got a copy of their layout without
  it, so a new slide with a background picture of its own takes the layout (by object id) of the
  converted slides with that background; one that inherits the master background takes the plain one. Updated slides: recreated units are
  built the same way; their old objects are deleted, the groups they were in are ungrouped
  (outermost first, since a group inside a group can't be ungrouped) and regrouped under the same
  ids (innermost first), and the new objects are brought into the old z position (`restack`).
  A group that would be left with one child disappears, its child taking its place.
  Placeholders are refilled in place.
- Template shapes (native shadows, exact corner radii, diagram nodes and elbow connectors) can't
  be copied across decks: a live object with the same template key is duplicated if there is one,
  else a plain 100 pt shape stands in and the report warns.
- `--dry-run` plans and reports without writing. A second sync with no changes sends no request
  (same revisionId) and leaves the base alone.
- After writing, the new base = ours IR + read-back of the objects as sync created them (before
  deck overrides are re-applied); units kept from the deck carry their old base.

## Reports
`sync-report.json` (top level: `applied`, `overrides`, `conflicts` with field, base, ours, theirs
and resolution, `converged`, `user_objects`, `slides_created`, `slides_deleted`, `slides_moved`,
`slides_kept`, `slides_user_added`, `warnings`, plus pdf, url, attempts, requests per phase and the
per-slide `actions`) and `sync-report.md`.

## Not supported yet
- Crossing reorders of unlabelled frames (the alignment keeps order; label frames).
- diff3 inside diagrams (a text edit there on both sides keeps the deck); tables merge per cell,
  but a row or column added in the deck keeps the deck's table.
- Layout texts and placeholder styles (`write_layout_texts`) aren't synced; nor are
  `fallback_pictures` rebuilds.
- Z-order edits in the deck aren't detected; a recreated unit goes back to its old z position.

## Pull: deck edits back to the source
```
beamer2slides pull --deck <url|id|out folder> --tex main.tex [--apply | --out DIR] [--max-iter N] [--work DIR]
beamer2slides converge --target deck.json --tex main.tex [same options]      # offline twin
```
Pull is an inverse problem solved by a loop, not a replay of recorded edits: it edits the source
until the source's own conversion matches the deck. It only reads the deck (`presentations.get`
and picture downloads), so the deck revision never changes; it needs no base snapshot.

1. **Target** (`deck_ir.py`): the live deck as deck.json-shaped IR. Text boxes give paragraphs,
   runs (bold, italic, colour, links, scripts; formula holes from Roboto Mono no-break spaces) and
   bullets; sizes go back to PDF pt through FontMapper, positions through emit's text box model
   (anchor = text start by alignment and first baseline, / scale), so a converted deck read back
   equals classify's IR (tests/slides_sim.py replays emit's requests to check it offline; on a live
   deck the unedited talk reads back with 0 residuals). Numbered balls (picture + number box) and
   diagram groups (node shapes joined by lines) fold back into one element; pictures are
   downloaded and hashed; notes, background colours and tables are read too. Slide keys come from
   `b2s:<slide key>/<element key>` alt-text titles or a base's object map when present.
2. **Loop** (`inverse.converge`): a working copy of the source tree (`<work>/loop/src`) is compiled
   with the document's engine (`% !TEX program`, fontspec → lualatex; `-synctex=1`, reruns on
   "Rerun"), then prepared, extracted and classified like `convert` (notes pages, last overlay step,
   panels verified like render). SyncTeX maps pages to frames (`texmap.page_frames`; inside a frame
   SyncTeX only names `\end{frame}`, so words are then located by printed text: `texmap.build_visible`
   maps every printed character to its source span, math is opaque, `\input`/`\include` followed).
3. **Compare** (`compare.py`): slides by key, then by title/text alignment (reorders detected);
   paragraphs across the slide; residuals with tolerances (`TOL`: 2 pt positions, 3 pt sizes, 6%
   font size, colour distance 24): slide missing/extra/order, notes, background, paragraph
   missing/extra/order, text (word diff), style ranges, bullet kind and relative level, alignment,
   element missing/extra, geometry (text anchors; picture, shape and table boxes), picture hash,
   shape fill, table cells, diagram labels. Whole frame-title size/colour and title positions are
   `theme` differences: reported, never written.
4. **Translate** (`inverse.Planner`), keeping the diff minimal and semantic: slide edits first and
   alone (new frame after its predecessor with title, lists, notes and `[label=key]`; frame deleted;
   frame block moved), then words (replace/insert/delete in plain source spans, word by word across
   commands), styles (`\textbf`, `\emph`, `\underline`, `\texttt`, `\textcolor` + `\definecolor`,
   size switches; wrap, unwrap or split the enclosing group), lists rebuilt from their items' own
   source (items added, deleted, reordered, relevelled), plain paragraphs inserted or deleted,
   `\note{}`, `\setbeamercolor{background canvas}`, new text boxes and pictures as `textblock*`
   (textpos, absolute page pt; picture files copied to `figures/b2s-<sha>`), and geometry last,
   top first, deferred on slides whose content changes that round: textblocks shift by the error,
   flow text moves vertically with `\par\vspace` (beamer centres frames: the gain is learned by
   secant updates), otherwise it is cut into a textblock at the target with a spacer keeping its
   flow room; pictures change width first.
5. **Stop**: within tolerance, `--max-iter` (10), or no edit left. Edits of words, styles and notes,
   new boxes and new slides are written once, added paragraphs twice, other residuals until they stop improving; repeated states stop the loop;
   a round that breaks the build is replayed one edit at a time and the breaking edits dropped.

Output in `--work` (default `<out folder>/pull`): `target.json`, `pull.patch`, `edits.json` and
`edits.md` (iterations with open residuals by kind and geometry error, the patch, theme
differences, and every unresolved residual with its reason, `file:line` range of its frame and the
target values, for an AI author to finish). `--apply` writes the changed files in place (`.bak`
backups) and copies new picture files; `--out DIR` writes the edited source tree there instead;
neither leaves the source untouched. After the rebuilt PDF is synced, the pulled fields are
converged overrides.

### Pictures (`deck_ir.picture_props`, `inverse.Planner.picture`, `compare.displayed_picture`)
What a picture in the deck can be recovered from, measured on a live deck by `tools/probe_images.py`:

| source | pixels | crop | rotation | transparency | brightness/contrast | recolour | outline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `contentUrl` (`=s2048`) | the stored file byte for byte | kept as `cropProperties` | kept in the transform | kept as a property | **baked** by Google on import | **baked** (duotone; greyscale is dropped) | kept as a property |
| `.pptx` export (`files.export`) | the same bytes | `a:srcRect` | `xfrm rot` | `a:alphaModFix` | baked | baked | `a:ln` |
| `sourceUrl` | the original, when the picture came in by URL and is still fetchable | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Google stores at most ~2046 px on the long side (a 3000 × 2000 PNG comes back 2046 × 1364, PNG
stays PNG, JPEG stays JPEG, an animated GIF keeps its frames, EMF/WMF become PNG). `contentUrl` is
therefore the recovery source; `sourceUrl` is used only when it holds the same picture with more
pixels. The bytes are saved as they are, never re-encoded or downscaled.

Pull writes each edit as a LaTeX option where LaTeX can express it, and bakes only what it can't:
- crop → `trim=l b r t,clip` in the file's natural bp (pixels at its dpi, a PDF's first page);
- rotation → `angle=` (Slides turns clockwise about the centre; the turned picture is placed by its
  bounding box, so no `origin` is needed), mirroring → `\reflectbox`;
- transparency → a `\tikz\node[inner sep=0pt,text opacity=…]`, a tikzpicture → a transparency group;
- outline → the same tikz node with `draw=` and `line width=`;
- brightness, contrast and recolour → baked into the saved file, and said so in `edits.md`;
- animated GIF, WEBP and other formats pdflatex can't read → PNG, first frame, with a note;
- pictures with edits or without a source of their own go into a `textblock*` at their bounding box.

Files are `figures/<slug of the alt text or `picture`>-<sha8>.<ext>`, but a picture already in the
source tree is reused instead: identical bytes first, else the best-resolution file that looks the
same (64 × 64 grey, correlation ≥ 0.98, aspect within 2%) — a PDF before any raster.

A picture the person put over a figure the source draws (tikzpicture, pgfplots) replaces it: the
environment is commented out under `% b2s pull: replaced by <file>`, with a `\phantom` keeping its
flow room when the picture goes into a textblock. Formula and icon pictures inside text lines are
never replaced silently: they are reported (`compare` matches them by thumbnail alone, tolerance
`inline_phash`). Replaced figures are found by thumbnail: mean difference plus, for opaque pictures
with contrast, correlation (`compare.picture_differs`) — a curve replaced by bars differs by only
0.11 on white, while transparent overlays must be judged by the mean alone.

Results: offline test bed (`python -m pytest -m inverse`, ~2 min) converges on 4 source pairs in one
round each and on 10 synthetic edits of 01_basic in 1-3 rounds; live, the sync talk edited in Slides
(reword, bold, 30 pt move, new red text box, new slide with bullets) converged in 3 rounds (~40 s)
and the deck converted from the pulled source compares to the edited deck with 0 open residuals
(text anchors within 2.1 pt), only the new slide's layout title differing (theme).
Pictures, live (`tools/pull_images_proof.py` on the same talk: a 3000 × 2000 photo inserted, cropped
and turned 12°, the TikZ plot replaced by a chart, a half-transparent picture added): converged in 4
rounds, and the deck converted from the pulled source compares to the edited deck with 0 open
residuals (largest picture box error 1.9 pt); the photo is on disk as Google's 2046 × 1364 PNG,
6.1 MB, unchanged.

### Note for sync and convert
- **After a pull, sync must not duplicate the pulled picture.** The source now has an
  `\includegraphics` where the person had inserted (or replaced with) a deck picture, so the new
  conversion carries a picture the deck already shows. Treat them as the same unit when the
  fingerprint matches: the file's sha1 (identical bytes are the normal case — pull saves the deck's
  own bytes), else a perceptual match (`compare.picture_hash` / `inverse.same_look`: 64 × 64 grey,
  correlation ≥ 0.98, aspect within 2%) **and** boxes overlapping by most of their area on the same
  slide key. On a match, keep the deck's object (its id, crop, rotation, transparency and outline are
  the person's edit, and the source now says the same) and record it in the base as converged instead
  of deleting the deck picture and creating a new one. A source figure that was commented out by pull
  (`% b2s pull: replaced by <file>`) disappears from the conversion: its base unit must be retired
  without deleting the deck object that replaced it.
  Done (`sync.picture_adopter`, live scenario `pull-picture`): a new picture unit whose file has the
  bytes or the look of an unmatched deck object overlapping its box is adopted (`adopt_object`), and a
  deck object whose own picture was replaced by the one the source now draws converges instead of
  conflicting. A figure only commented out is a unit the source removed, so its objects are deleted
  unless the deck edited or deleted them - the object that replaced it is a different one.
- **Convert should pass raster `\includegraphics` through losslessly.** Today a figure region is
  re-rendered from the page, so a 2046 px photo becomes a ~600 px crop and a pull afterwards can only
  recover that. PDFium gives the image object's own bitmap (`FPDFImageObj_GetImageDataDecoded` /
  `GetRenderedBitmap`): when a figure region is one image object with no vector ink on it, store its
  bytes and its transform instead of the rendered crop. The deck then keeps the author's full
  resolution, and a pull returns the same file.

Not translated yet (reported instead): tables, diagram labels, shape colours, paragraph alignment,
frame title position and theme styles, edits inside math, rotated text, overlays beyond the last
step (compile with `--handout` to pull a handout-style deck).

## Never lose deck edits

`convert` on an output folder that already has a deck does **not** create a new presentation: it
replaces that deck's whole content through `files.update`, so the URL stays and everything anyone
did in Slides is gone. That is the only write in the tool that can destroy a deck, and it used to
happen silently. `guard.py` now stands in front of it.

### What convert does now

Before any work (and again immediately before the write, in case someone typed in the deck while
the PDF was being converted), `guard.check_rebuild` reads the live deck with `presentations.get`
and compares it with the sync base (`<out>/sync/base.json`, or Drive `appProperties.b2sBase` -
whichever `snapshot.load_base` finds; Drive wins). It refuses for three reasons:

| reason | when | message says |
|---|---|---|
| `edited` | someone changed the deck since the converter wrote it | what was edited, with up to 3 examples |
| `no-base` | there is no base, so the question cannot be answered | the base is written by `convert`; older decks have none |
| `other-source` | the base says this folder's deck came from another PDF | rebuilding here would replace that deck with this PDF's slides |

A refusal exits non-zero (`RebuildRefused` → `SystemExit`) and nothing is written. It looks like
this (from `tools/rebuild_guard_proof.py`, a real run):

```
refusing to rebuild: this deck was edited in Google Slides after beamer2slides wrote it.
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11yU.../edit
  1 slide edited: 1 text edit, 1 object added in Slides
    - slide 2 "Why decks and sources diverge": text edited (text/body/0: "The source is HANDWRITTEN in by an auth…")
    - slide 2 "Why decks and sources diverge": 1 object(s) added in Slides
  A rebuild replaces the whole deck. What to do instead:
    merge the PDF into the deck, keeping the edits:  python -m beamer2slides sync talk.pdf --deck out\talk
    leave that deck alone and make a new one:        python -m beamer2slides convert talk.pdf --out out\talk --new-deck
    rebuild anyway (the deck's content is replaced): python -m beamer2slides convert talk.pdf --out out\talk --force-rebuild
  The deck is at revision 2Ymo8YWHlbj6kg; a forced rebuild keeps a backup first (--backup, docs/sync.md).
```

### What counts as an edit

Exactly what sync would keep, through the same code: `merge.deck_edits` (geometry, text, text
style, shape style, image, group, deleted, part_deleted), `merge.user_objects` (objects the
converter never made), `merge.background_edited`, speaker notes, plus slides added, deleted or
reordered. There is one notion of "edited" in the tool, not two.

Deliberately **not** an edit:
- a new `revisionId` - Google bumps it on its own (opening the deck is enough);
- a new `contentUrl` for a picture nobody touched - Google reissues those; pixel signatures decide
  (`guard.sign_changed`, the same rule as `sync.Sync.sign_changed`), and only pictures whose URL
  hash changed are downloaded;
- exporting a thumbnail (`fidelity`, `measure_places`);
- `measure_places`' scratch slides `b2s_mNNN` left by an interrupted run - converter leftovers,
  filtered out before the comparison.

### Getting a deck back

Before every destructive write the deck's `revisionId`, Drive `modifiedTime` and what was found
are appended to `<out>/backups/backups.json` (and the rebuild's entry goes into `emit.json` as
`previous`), and the same lines are printed. `--backup` decides what else is kept:

| `--backup` | convert | sync |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | a `.pptx` export when the rebuild is forced, nothing when the deck was untouched | a `.pptx` export before the first write |
| `none` | nothing | nothing |
| `file` | `.pptx` in `<out>/backups` | the same |
| `drive` | a Drive copy of the presentation (its own URL) | the same |
| `both` | both | both |

`tools/deck_backup.py` lists (`list`), exports (`export`) and restores (`restore --from FILE`, or
from a revision). A restore creates a **new** presentation by default; `--in-place` writes the
backup back over the deck.

> **Measured, not guessed** (`tools/probe_revision_history.py`): for a Google-native presentation
> Drive does keep a revision row per editing session, and `revisions.list` shows them - but every
> revision's export link returns the file's **current** content, even with `revision=N` in the URL,
> and `revisions.update(keepForever=True)` does not change that. So a `files.update` rebuild leaves
> **nothing the API can fetch back**: version history is evidence, not a recovery path. The live
> proof confirms it end to end - the export of the revision from before a forced rebuild does not
> contain the word that was typed into the deck (`drive_history.holds_the_edit == false` in
> `out/agent-guard/proof.json`), while the `.pptx` backup restored into a new deck still shows it.
> Version history in the Slides UI ("File → Version history") may still show the old state to a
> human; treat it as worth a try, never as a promise. **The `.pptx` backup is the way back.**

### The other in-place writes

- `--new-deck` creates a new presentation and prints `the previous deck is left as it is at <url>`:
  it never touches the old one (proved live: the old deck's revision is unchanged afterwards).
- A **trashed or deleted** previous deck is never resurrected or written to: `guard.previous_deck`
  reports `live` / `trashed` / `gone` / `other` (not a presentation), and anything but `live` makes
  convert create a new deck and say so.
- A **stale output folder** (its deck was converted from another PDF) is the `other-source` refusal
  above.
- **Sync's staging deck** can never be the user's deck: `Sync.stage` uses the id `files.create`
  just returned, and the only ids ever passed to `files().delete` in `sync.py` are that staging id
  and the picture file it made (checked at runtime and statically in `tests/test_guard.py`).
- **Sync's first write** is not a rebuild - it only rewrites what the source changed - but it is
  still a write, so `record_sync_point` records the revision and takes a `.pptx` backup
  (`--backup`), prints a `recovery:` block, and puts the entry into `<out>/sync/sync-report.json`
  as `recovery`.

### Tests

- `tests/test_guard.py` (23 tests, no Google calls): fake read-backs in the style of
  `tests/test_sync.py` cover every detection case above (including the reissued `contentUrl` and
  the scratch slides), the three refusal reasons, `--force-rebuild`, the backup modes and the
  export-refused → Drive-copy fallback, the recorded entry and its restore hint, `plan_rebuild`'s
  paths (untouched, forced, refused, `--new-deck`, trashed, gone) and the staging-deck proof.
- `python tools/rebuild_guard_proof.py` (live, ~2 min, fixed folders `out/agent-guard/<deck>`):
  convert → convert again (no false alarm) → edit like a person (`tools/deck_edits.py`) → convert
  refuses with exit code 1 and the deck's revision and edit are untouched → `--force-rebuild`
  rebuilds and records the backup → the backup restores into a deck that still shows the edit →
  Drive history recorded as evidence → `--new-deck` leaves the old deck alone → a trashed deck
  reads back as trashed. Evidence in `out/agent-guard/proof.json` and `proof.log`.
